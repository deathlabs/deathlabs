# `deathlabs`
This project automates the deployment of Detection Engineering and Threat Hunting (DEATH) labs. It was heavily inspired by Chris Long's [DetectionLab](https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab) and Eric Capuano's DEFCON 25 talk [Go Beyond Tabletop Scenarios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4WguNB8s-4&t=2169s).
